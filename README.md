# Phase 3, Lecture 3: Object Oriented Programming in Python

## Lecture Topics

- Classes
- Instances
- Initializing with attributes using init
- Instance methods
- Self
- Object properties

## Introduction

In today's lecture, we will discuss topics of Object Oriented Programming in Python such as classes, instances, `__init__`, attributes, instance methods, self, and object properties.

## Setup

1. Make sure that your current working directory (folder) contains a `Pipfile`, then run `pipenv install` in your terminal to install `pytest` and any other required libraries.
2. Now that your `pipenv` virtual environment is ready to use, enter `pipenv shell` to start working.
<!-- 3. Run `pytest` from inside of the `phase-3-lecture-2-python-data-structures` directory (if you can see `lib`, `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock`, `pytest.ini`, and `README.md` in your current working directory, then you are in the correct directory) to run the tests, and begin working to pass the tests. You can also run `pytest -x` to run one test at a time. -->
